## Tiktok scraping

Most of the code is written in R, but it also leverages Python code and
it also requires [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to be
installed.

Use the `reticulate` package to create a new conda environment and then
install everything within that environment using `conda_install()`. To
ensure that the proper conda environment is used, either set the
.Renviron or use `Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON=dir/to/env)`.
