agent on top of it all right so the code

190
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
agent on top of it all right so the code
 

191
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,070
agent on top of it all right so the code
that I'm working out of is this app.py

192
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
that I'm working out of is this app.py
 

193
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,630
that I'm working out of is this app.py
that's this streamlet file here okay and

194
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:35,640
that's this streamlet file here okay and
 

195
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,190
that's this streamlet file here okay and
what we're covering today is the SQL

196

what we're covering today is the SQL
 

197
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,270
what we're covering today is the SQL
database agent what it is so I already

198
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,280
database agent what it is so I already
 

199
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,910
database agent what it is so I already
kind of showed you what that was second

200
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
kind of showed you what that was second
 

201
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,550

label here and where that's going to pop
 

271
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,350
label here and where that's going to pop
up is it's going to pop up right over

272
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
up is it's going to pop up right over
 

273
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,710
up is it's going to pop up right over
here your select database you see this

274
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:01,720
here your select database you see this
 

275
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,790
here your select database you see this
let me escape out of that yeah for some

276
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:03,800
let me escape out of that yeah for some
 

277
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,310
let me escape out of that yeah for some
reason the Apple thing keeps popping up

278
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:05,320
reason the Apple thing keeps popping up
 

279
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,510
reason the Apple thing keeps popping up
but anyways you're going to have a list

280
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
but anyways you're going to have a list
 

281
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,550
but anyways you're going to have a list
of databases okay so that's what's

282
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
of databases okay so that's what's
 

283
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,150
of databases okay so that's what's
that's what this is and then you're

284
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
that's what this is and then you're
 

285
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,629
that's what this is and then you're
going to add a query string okay and

286
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:13,639
going to add a query string okay and
 

287
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,550
going to add a query string okay and
that's going to be the string that's

288
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:15,560
that's going to be the string that's
 

289
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,270
that's going to be the string that's
going to connect you to your database if

290
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
going to connect you to your database if
 

291
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,270
going to connect you to your database if
you have a MySQL server or whatever else

292
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
you have a MySQL server or whatever else
 

293
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,830
you have a MySQL server or whatever else
you're going to put that in here and

294
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:20,840
you're going to put that in here and
 

295
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,550
you're going to put that in here and
you're going to connect up to it just

296
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
you're going to connect up to it just
 

297
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,909
you're going to connect up to it just
like the string that you would use to

298
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
like the string that you would use to
 

299
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,230
like the string that you would use to
connect up through SQL Alchemy all right

300
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
connect up through SQL Alchemy all right
 

301
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,990

will populate is once you put an API key
in this will pop up down here and you

312
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
in this will pop up down here and you
 

313
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,830
in this will pop up down here and you
can choose your model but you have to

314
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:42,840
can choose your model but you have to
 

315
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,189
can choose your model but you have to
have a an API key and you're going to PO

316
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
have a an API key and you're going to PO
 

317
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,550
have a an API key and you're going to PO
paste that in here so make sure you go

318
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
paste that in here so make sure you go
 

319
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,629
paste that in here so make sure you go
to open AI get an API key from them and

320
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:49,639
to open AI get an API key from them and
 

321
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,029
to open AI get an API key from them and
then you're going to paste that in here

322
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
then you're going to paste that in here
 

323
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,629
then you're going to paste that in here
and then what you'll be able to do is

324
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
and then what you'll be able to do is
 

325
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,029
and then what you'll be able to do is
start running that okay the rest is kind

326
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
start running that okay the rest is kind
 

327
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,390
start running that okay the rest is kind

down here that tells you a little bit
 

337
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,469
down here that tells you a little bit
about what this agent does so that's

338
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:07,479
about what this agent does so that's
 

339
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,029
about what this agent does so that's
this piece here we've got a little

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,360
your database we're going to store that
 

361
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,230
your database we're going to store that
in the session state

362
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
in the session state
 

363
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,469
in the session state
and then also create a connection that

364
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
and then also create a connection that
 

365
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,189
and then also create a connection that
connection object will be used when we

366
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,199
connection object will be used when we
 

367
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,350
connection object will be used when we
create the seq agent this is the open AI

368
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,360
create the seq agent this is the open AI
 

369
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,309
create the seq agent this is the open AI
logic that makes sure that you've got a

370
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
logic that makes sure that you've got a
 

371
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,710
logic that makes sure that you've got a
valid API key before we proceed and then

372
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:41,720
valid API key before we proceed and then
 

373
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,029
valid API key before we proceed and then
if you do have an open AI API key in

374
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
if you do have an open AI API key in
 

375
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,950
if you do have an open AI API key in
there then this stuff will appear down

376
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
there then this stuff will appear down
 

377
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,469
there then this stuff will appear down
here where you can actually select the

378

here where you can actually select the
 

379
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,189
here where you can actually select the
model all right next part is the

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:50,199
model all right next part is the
 

381
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,749
model all right next part is the
streamlet app so this is the most

382
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
streamlet app so this is the most
 

383
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,230
streamlet app so this is the most
complicated part we've got a streamlet

384
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
complicated part we've got a streamlet
 

385
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,390
complicated part we've got a streamlet
chat history that's what populates all

386
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
chat history that's what populates all
 

387
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,070
chat history that's what populates all
of this stuff here so the streamlet chat

388
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,080
of this stuff here so the streamlet chat
 

389
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,189

and then you've got a little indicator

392
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:02,840
and then you've got a little indicator
 

393
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,589
and then you've got a little indicator
here or a little session state where

394
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:04,599
here or a little session state where
 

395
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:06,869
here or a little session state where
we're going to add in session State data

396
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:06,879
we're going to add in session State data
 

397
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,189
we're going to add in session State data
frames and we're going to keep track of

going to be producing these data frames
 

403
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,510
going to be producing these data frames
here we need to store those somewhere so

404
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:14,520
here we need to store those somewhere so
 

405
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,950
here we need to store those somewhere so
we're going to keep track as the user

SQL database agent when it makes the

468
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
SQL database agent when it makes the
 

469
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,070
SQL database agent when it makes the
queries and we're also going to bypass

470
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
queries and we're also going to bypass
 

471
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,670
queries and we're also going to bypass
one of the key steps which is a

472
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
one of the key steps which is a
 

473
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,589
one of the key steps which is a
recommendation step just to speed up our

474
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:26,599
recommendation step just to speed up our
 

475
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,550
recommendation step just to speed up our
process of building queries okay this

476
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
process of building queries okay this
 

477
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,070
process of building queries okay this
function here

478
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
function here
 

479
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,830
function here
this async defa might look a little

480
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
this async defa might look a little
 

481
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,990
this async defa might look a little
weird if you've ever done asynchronous

482
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
weird if you've ever done asynchronous
 

483
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,029
weird if you've ever done asynchronous
programming before but basically what

484
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:36,039
programming before but basically what
 

485
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,630
programming before but basically what
this is going to do is it's going to

486
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:37,640
this is going to do is it's going to
 

487
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,829
this is going to do is it's going to
invoke our agent

488
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
invoke our agent
 

489
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,709
invoke our agent
asynchronously why is that important

490
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:41,719
asynchronously why is that important
 

491
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,389
asynchronously why is that important
because inside of applications if you

492
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:43,399
because inside of applications if you
 

493
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,670
because inside of applications if you
got multiple users pounding you know

494
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
got multiple users pounding you know
 

495
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,110
got multiple users pounding you know
llms and trying to like Ping your you

496
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,120
llms and trying to like Ping your you
 

497
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,350
llms and trying to like Ping your you
know ping ping your if it's your open AI

498
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,360
know ping ping your if it's your open AI
 

499
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,590
know ping ping your if it's your open AI
account and they're all trying to Ping

500
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
account and they're all trying to Ping
 

501
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,630
account and they're all trying to Ping
it at once what they would have to do is

502
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:55,640
it at once what they would have to do is
 

503
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,350
it at once what they would have to do is
wait sequentially for each one of those

504
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
wait sequentially for each one of those
 

505
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,350
wait sequentially for each one of those
llm calls to be complete this async does

506
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
llm calls to be complete this async does
 

507
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,790
llm calls to be complete this async does
what that does is it allows you to

508
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
what that does is it allows you to
 

509
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,310
what that does is it allows you to
asynchronously if you have multiple

510
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
asynchronously if you have multiple
 

511
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,069
asynchronously if you have multiple
users of your app at the same time call

512
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:07,079
users of your app at the same time call
 

513
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,590
users of your app at the same time call
those queries asyn asynchronously uh

514
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
those queries asyn asynchronously uh
 

515
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,230
those queries asyn asynchronously uh
very handy so whenever you're inside of

516
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
very handy so whenever you're inside of
 

517
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,069
very handy so whenever you're inside of
apps you always want to have async

518
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:14,079
apps you always want to have async
 

519
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:16,550
apps you always want to have async
functions okay and then this is the part

520
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:16,560
functions okay and then this is the part
 

521
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,949
functions okay and then this is the part
that actually processes the query so

522
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
that actually processes the query so
 

523
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,829
that actually processes the query so
what you're going to have is once the

524
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
what you're going to have is once the
 

525
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,190
what you're going to have is once the
user enters a question in and as long as

526
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
user enters a question in and as long as
 

527
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,350
user enters a question in and as long as
they have a path to their database

528
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
they have a path to their database
 

529
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,550
they have a path to their database
present what it's going to do is if they

530
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:27,560
present what it's going to do is if they
 

531
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,630
present what it's going to do is if they
have an open AI account that's been but

532
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:29,640
have an open AI account that's been but
 

533
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,389
have an open AI account that's been but
verified uh it's then going to move on

534
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:31,399
verified uh it's then going to move on
 

535
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,230
verified uh it's then going to move on
to this logic here so what we're

536
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
to this logic here so what we're
 

537
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,190
to this logic here so what we're
doing is we're going to process and as

538
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,200
doing is we're going to process and as
 

539
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,550
doing is we're going to process and as
asynchronously we're going to run that

540
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:39,560
asynchronously we're going to run that
 

541
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,590
asynchronously we're going to run that
handle question function which is this

542
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,600
handle question function which is this
 

543
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,990
handle question function which is this
thing here all it does is just creates

544
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
thing here all it does is just creates
 

545
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,190
thing here all it does is just creates
from our created SQL database agent it's

546
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,200
from our created SQL database agent it's
 

547
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,509
from our created SQL database agent it's
just going to invoke it with whatever

548
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
just going to invoke it with whatever
 

549
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,230
just going to invoke it with whatever
the user question is all right and it's

550
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:49,240
the user question is all right and it's
 

551
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,949
the user question is all right and it's
going to return the SQL agent dated with

552
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
going to return the SQL agent dated with
 

553
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,630
going to return the SQL agent dated with
you know as it processes the question

554
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:54,640
you know as it processes the question
 

555
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,030
you know as it processes the question
it's going to have methods in here that

556
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,040
it's going to have methods in here that
 

557
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,350
it's going to have methods in here that
we can call okay so we're going to call

558
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,360
we can call okay so we're going to call
 

559
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,430
we can call okay so we're going to call
those methods down here assuming that

560
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,440
those methods down here assuming that
 

561
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,230
those methods down here assuming that
there's no error and we we get the

562
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,240
there's no error and we we get the
 

563
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,750
there's no error and we we get the
asynchronous result back what we're

564
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
asynchronous result back what we're
 

565
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,750
asynchronous result back what we're
going to grab out is the SQL query code

566
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:06,760
going to grab out is the SQL query code
 

567
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,630
going to grab out is the SQL query code
from that agent and we're going to grab

568
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
from that agent and we're going to grab
 

569
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,110
from that agent and we're going to grab
out the data from that SQL query so once

570
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
out the data from that SQL query so once
 

571
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,590
out the data from that SQL query so once
the SQL query gets executed on the

572
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
the SQL query gets executed on the
 

573
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,870
the SQL query gets executed on the
database it returns a data frame and

574
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
database it returns a data frame and
 

575
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,910
database it returns a data frame and
that's we're going to just take those

576
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
that's we're going to just take those
 

577
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,350
that's we're going to just take those
two and we're going to pop it in so if

578
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:18,360
two and we're going to pop it in so if
 

579
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,630
two and we're going to pop it in so if
there's a response we're going to

580
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
there's a response we're going to
 

581
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,389
there's a response we're going to
produce the SQL query as marked down and

582
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
produce the SQL query as marked down and
 

583
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,509
produce the SQL query as marked down and
then what we're going to do here is add

584
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
then what we're going to do here is add
 

585
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,990
then what we're going to do here is add
the data data frame to our session State

586
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
the data data frame to our session State
 

587
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,509
the data data frame to our session State
data frames so we're going to add add

588
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
data frames so we're going to add add
 

589
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,829
data frames so we're going to add add
that up here so we can track it and then

590
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
that up here so we can track it and then
 

591
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,750
that up here so we can track it and then
we're also going to print out the

592
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
we're also going to print out the
 

593
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,110
we're also going to print out the
response here okay and that's what we're

594
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,120
response here okay and that's what we're
 

595
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,949
response here okay and that's what we're
doing that's all there is to this app so

596
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:37,959
doing that's all there is to this app so
 

597
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,629
doing that's all there is to this app so
the beautiful part is you can literally

598
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:39,639
the beautiful part is you can literally
 

599
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,990
the beautiful part is you can literally
take this application update it with

600
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
take this application update it with
 

601
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,069
take this application update it with
your database options it's all ready to

602
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
your database options it's all ready to
 

603
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,870
your database options it's all ready to
run on any database that you want to use

604
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:45,880
run on any database that you want to use
 

605
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,150
run on any database that you want to use
let's give it a test spin here I'll

606
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,160
let's give it a test spin here I'll
 

607
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,110
let's give it a test spin here I'll
refresh it and I'll show you that it's

608
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
refresh it and I'll show you that it's
 

609
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,590
refresh it and I'll show you that it's
working if I pop in my SQL or my API key

610
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
working if I pop in my SQL or my API key
 

611
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,870
working if I pop in my SQL or my API key
oops wrong API key here let me grab an

612
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:55,880
oops wrong API key here let me grab an
 

613
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,230
oops wrong API key here let me grab an
API key uh here I'll throw this one in

614
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:58,240
API key uh here I'll throw this one in
 

615
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,350
API key uh here I'll throw this one in
here see if this one works

616
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,360
here see if this one works
 

617
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,949
here see if this one works
and we're good okay so we can see what

618
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
and we're good okay so we can see what
 

619
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,069
and we're good okay so we can see what
tables exist in the

620
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:05,079
tables exist in the
 

621
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,230
tables exist in the
database boom pop that in here run that
